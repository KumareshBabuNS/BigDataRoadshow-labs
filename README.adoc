TODO: Sessions description

== Contents

So far this consists of:

* this README
* a link:prerequisites.adoc[prerequisites.adoc] doc
* the link:decks[Slide Decks] (in Keynote or PPTx format)
* the link:labs[Labs] (in adoc format)

== Environment

The labs are built for running on any environment with the right products installed.  
For making it simpler and avoiding further risks, we'll deliver them leveraging
 * Amazon AMIs [info to be linked]
 * VM distributed as a thumb drive 
 
VMs are delivered with the products installed, and labs will be cloned from this Github repo (containing instructions, scripts and small binaries / sources)
